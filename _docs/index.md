## What is VizRob

VizRob is a set of visualizations to understand and debug the execution behavior-based robotics developed using nested state machine.

VizRob uses the static representation of a nested machine and combines it with run-time information: execution time and logs produced by the program.
These informations are presented in several, custom visualizations to understand several aspects of the execution of the behavior of your robots.

VizRob first conception works with SMACH, a State Machine API for Python: <http://wiki.ros.org/smach>.

We expected to support more state machines API. 
If you want VizRob in your own state machine API, just [contact us](../contact), we can help you!

## Acknowledgments 

We want to thanks all people that make VizRob possible. In particular, we would like to thanks the following colleagues for the semi-structured interview that help us to shape VizRob: David Conner, Loy Vanbeek and Cristopher GÃ³mez. Also, we would like to thanks the UChile Homebreakers team for their helpful participation in our case studies that help us to evaluate VizRob.
