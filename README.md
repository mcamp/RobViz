# RobViz

RobViz is a set of visualizations for the execution of nested state machine using execution time and logs produced by the program.

RobViz first conception works with SMACH, a State Machine api for Python: http://wiki.ros.org/smach
While RobViz is thought to work with other State Machine APIs, for now it only connection is SMACH.

Currently, GitHub only hosts the issue tracker.
