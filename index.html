              <p>
                VizRob is a tool to help debug and understand what is happening within the behavior of a robot.
                VizRob provides several visualization with different, grouped, information of the execution of the behavior of your robots.
                If the behavior of your robot is defined with a nested state machine (or several), then VizRob is for you!
                In VizRob you can see the definition of your machines, grouped with logs information and/or execution time.
                With VizRob you can focus in the important part of the execution based on the run-time data of the behavior of your robots.
                To start using VizRob, just go to our <a href="{{"/docs/installation/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" >installation page</a>.
